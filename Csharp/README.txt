This C sharp source is divided into three #Develop projects.
ip2country is the assembly that the other two uses.
ip2c is the command line tool.
ip2c_bench is the GUI benchmarking tool.

build.bat builds the projects, and puts the executables in:
 .\<project>\bin\Debug

If you don't know what #Develop is, hurry over to:

    http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/

And download it, it's a superb free development IDE for Windows.
The only thing it needs is a debugger, and that is on it's way ;)
If you're a linux guy, there is monodevelop:

    http://www.monodevelop.com/

Which is a port of #Develop, but it's not complete.
